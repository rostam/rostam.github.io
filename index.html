<h1>Ali Rostami</h1>
<h3>Data Scientist and Postdoctoral Researcher</h3>
<img src="ali.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="Photo: M. Ali Rostami, 2013">
<p>
    My name is Ali and I am currently working as a senior researcher in Big Data competence center
    (<a href="https://www.scads.de/en/">ScaDS</a>).
    I did my BSc in Applied Mathematics at Sharif University of Tehran
    and my MSc in Media Informatics at RWTH Aachen, Germany. I finished my PhD
    in Parallelization Strategies at University of Jena in 2017.
</p><p>
    I have a strong mathematical background and been always working in the areas
    relevant to both mathematics and computer science.
    My teaching experiences involves parallel programming, visual analytic, and big data, and supervising
    several seminars and bachelor/master thesis.
    In addition to the research and teaching positions, I have also exposed to the leading
    responsibility while coordinating the
    <a href="http://www.graphtheorysoftware.com/">GraphTea</a> project as an international
    collaboration.
    <!--I have also had various educational talks about the Borsak-Ulam theorem and graph -->
    <!--homomorphisms.-->
</p><p>
    I have proficiency in several programming languages and technologies such as
    Java/Scala, C++17, Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), and JS/node.js. I am pretty experienced in parallelization
    libraries like MPI, OpenMP/Threading, Apache Flink, Apache Spark,
    and CUDA. Additionally, I have some experiences with Go and Rust programming languages.

</p><p>
    My native language is Persian. I speak fluent English and German and know a little bit of
    Spanish, Azeri, and Turkish.
    Since I am so passionate about languages, I teach Persian language relatively
    professionally in my spare time.
    I am crazy about music and play violin as a hobby since years.

<h2>Projects:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.urz.uni-leipzig.de/wir-ueber-uns/projekte/biggr/">BIGGR</a>
        is a collaborative project between the company KNIME (<a href="https://www.knime.com/">KNIME</a>) in
        Berlin and the Big Data competence center (<a href="https://www.scads.de/en/">ScaDS</a>) in
        Leipzig.
        In this project, we develop a software system in which a user without deep knowledge of big
        data processing can build a graph analysis workflows graphically from simple basic
        operators.
        I also implemented a visualization tool,
        called <a href="http://csc.inf-ra.uni-jena.de/server/gradoop.html">GradoopVis</a>,
        on this software which can be used separately as a web application as well as inside the
        KNIME software.
        For this purpose, the KNIME Analytics platform has been extended with a new set of tools
        that represent the GRADOOP operators and the possibility
        to execute the resulting workflows on a remote cluster.
        <a href="https://github.com/dbs-leipzig/gradoop">GRADOOP</a> is an open-source system,
        developed on Apache Flink, for graph analytics
        that enables handling of property graphs
        (both vertices and edges can have several properties).
        This is my current position started at 2017 and will finish at early 2019.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/rostam/SIMG-VIZ">SIMG-VIZ</a>
         A new visualization system for entity resolution and clustering that allows us to investigate different match and clustering techniques 
         for multi-source entity resolution. SIMG-VIZ offers the following key features:
         SIMG-VIZ allows a user to analyze precomputed similarity graphs and clustering from existing ER tools and also supports executing 
         and analyzing ER match tasks directly with FAMER.
         Different graph and ER cluster visualization techniques and layouts can be applied to choose the best visualizations. To increase performance, 
         some layouts can be precomputed on the server with either parallel or serial computation. 
         This provides a significant optimization potential in particular for force-directed layouts. To support visualization of large graphs, 
         preprocessing techniques such as sampling (also executed in parallel on the server) can be selected to obtain a fast overview 
         of large similarity graphs and their clustering results. Clusters and their overlaps as well as edges annotated with their type 
         and similarity are visualized by using a simple but useful cake-like visual metaphor. Users can interact with clusters and select individual clusters for investigation, 2017 - 2018.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.graphtheorysoftware.com/">GraphTea</a>
        is an <a href="https://github.com/graphtheorysoftware/GraphTea">open source</a> mathematical
        platform and library for graph
        algorithms and visualizations. I am a developer, designer and maintainer of project
        GraphTea. It is more than a group of developed algorithms
        but rather a platform in which desired algorithms could be easily implemented by a normal
        user.
        The GraphTea core is written in Java on which we develop a web user interface in Javascript.
        So the user can use GraphTea both locally and <a href="http://csc.inf-ra.uni-jena.de/server/index.html">online</a>, 2012 - Now.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://csc.inf-ra.uni-jena.de/server/ChemTea-Design.pdf">ChemTea</a> is a set of tools which I developed in which the
        user can
        run a given function on several graphs and see a table of results at the end.
        We called this tool at first <b>ChemTea</b> since we used these tools to compute
        several known parameters in chemical graph theory over huge set of graphs.
        Since the number of graphs grows exponentially I consider different methods
        from Big Data approaches. These tools are implemented first as an extension
        of GraphTea but then we started a separate project since it became big.
        There are some parts of C++ code as well as an interface for python.
        The software is not still publicly available, 2014 - Now.
    </li>

    <li><a href="http://csc.inf-ra.uni-jena.de/server/precol_doc/index.html">PreCol</a> is to compute the graph coloring and
        preconditioning in a way which gets benefit from
        Automatic Differentiation. The coloring algorithms are implemented in C++ because of efficiency
        and parallelism. We also developed two graphical interfaces for Java and MATLAB, 2013 - 2017.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://c3e.de/research/project/meprorisk">MeProRisk II</a>
        Geothermal reservoirs provide heat that can be used to generate clean, renewable, and
        plentiful energy. However, the exploration and the development of these reservoirs
        involve high engineering and economic risks. Despite steady improvements in drilling
        technology over the last decades, drilling of numerous deep boreholes
        from the surface into suitable rock types at a depth of some kilometers is still
        a major cost component of geothermal energy.
        The MeProRisk II project aims at reducing these risks by combining skills from different
        scientific disciplines. Geophysicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists from
        five German universities and a private company develop and apply new methods in seismic
        modeling and interpretation, numerical reservoir simulation, estimation of petrophysical
        parameters, and scientific visualization.
        My job was to include the parallel computing into the main software,
        called
        <a href="http://www.gge.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/E-ON-ERC-GGE/Forschung/Ausstattung/~fqun/Shemat-Software/?lidx=1">SHEMAT</a>,
        by considering all existing designs in code, 2012 - 2016.
    </li>

    <li><a href="http://csc.inf-ra.uni-jena.de/server/explain/index.html">EXPLAIN</a> is a set of interactive learning modules used in
        classroom to
        teach scientific computing concepts. They are web-based application
        written in Python and Javascript. The users can also interactively develop their algorithms
        in an online
        editor, which is available in the same page as the tool, and test the results instantly,
        2013 - 2016.
    </li>
    <li>
        Selected smaller projects which I did in my master:
        <b>Redmine Client</b> is a mobile client for the project management web application
        <b>Redmine</b> which is available for Android and IOS now. Humance AG, Cologne, May 2012 -
        November 2012.
        <b>Castle Crisis</b> is a Android location-based game which I developed during
        <a href="http://www.totem-games.org/?q=node/156">Bonn Fraunhofer summer school</a>, July
        2012.
        <b>AggGen</b> is to extract a 3D model of black Carbon based on
        TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) images. The project is implemented in MATLAB/C++
        and pursued different approaches toward the problem.
        mechanical group of RWTH Aachen, December 2011 - August 2012.
        <a href="https://www.openflipper.org/">OpenFlipper</a> is a C++ library for 3D graphics
        developed at RWTH Aachen.
        I was working on an algorithm to find the optimum hexagonal mesh of an object,
        which is widely used in the architecture, May 2011 - October 2011.
