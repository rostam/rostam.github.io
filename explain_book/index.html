<h2>Nested Dissection Ordering</h2>

Given a sparse positive definite system of linear equations, find a way to increase the
level of parallelism when using the Cholesky factorization. In this numerical technique, the
coefficient matrix $A$ is decomposed into the product of the form
$$
A=L L^T ,
$$
where the matrix $L$ is lower triangular. The factorization is typically carried out ``in-place,''
meaning that the same storage is used for the input~$A$ and the output $L$. That is, values of~$A$
are overwritten by values of~$L$. It is known for a long time \cite{graphgauss1961} that, for
sparse matrices $A$, there are matrix positions $(i,j)$ where the factorization process generates
nonzero values in $L$ where there were zeros in $A$. These additional nonzero elements in~$L$ are
called fill-in elements. An example of a matrix~$A$ of order 12 and its Cholesky factor is depicted
in \figref{f.no_bisection}. Here, a nonzero is indicated by the symbol $\times$ and a zero is
represented by the empty space. The fill-in elements in $L$ are marked by red bullets.

Now consider a reordering of the rows and columns of the matrix $A$ into a matrix $A^{\prime}$. In
formulae, this reordering is nothing but a symmetric permutation $A^{\prime}  = P A P^T$ of the
matrix $A$ where $P$ is a permutation matrix. Since symmetric permutations preserve the symmetry
and positive definiteness, the Cholesky factorization can also be applied to the reordered matrix,
i.e,
$$
A^{\prime} = L^{\prime} (L^{\prime})^T.
$$

It is well known \cite{ros:gra} that the reordering has an effect on the number and positions of
the fill-in elements. Therefore, one is interested in finding a permutation $P$ that is
advantageous in some sense. In the following, we try to find a reordering of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{e.A}
A^{\prime} =
\begin{bmatrix}
A_1 & 0   & B_1^T \\[0.2em]
0   & A_2 & B_2^T \\[0.2em]
B_1 & B_2 & C
\end{bmatrix} ,
\end{equation}
whose nonzero blocks are schematically depicted by color in the left of \figref{f.bisection}. We
will now describe why this reordering allows to execute two tasks in parallel.

It is known that, independent from the nonzero pattern within the colored parts of $A^{\prime}$,
fill-in elements in $L^{\prime}$ will not be generated in the zero block. In other words, we have
the following block form of a Cholesky decomposition:
\begin{equation*}
%\label{e.chol}
\begin{bmatrix}
A_1 & 0   & B_1^T \\[0.2em]
0   & A_2 & B_2^T \\[0.2em]
B_1 & B_2 & C
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
L_1 & 0   & 0 \\[0.2em]
0   & L_2 & 0 \\[0.2em]
E_1 & E_2 & D
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
L_1^T & 0   & E_1^T \\[0.2em]
0   & L_2^T & E_2^T \\[0.2em]
0   & 0     & D^T
\end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation*}
Thus, given the blocks $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$, $B_2$ and $C$ in the matrix~$A^{\prime}$, we
immediately find the blocks $L_1$, $L_2$, $E_1$, $E_2$ and $D$ in its Cholesky factor $L^{\prime}$
as follows:
\begin{align}
  A_1        &= L_1 L_1^T,  \label{e.a1}\\[0.2em]
  A_2        &= L_2 L_2^T,  \label{e.a2}\\[0.2em]
  L_1 E_1^T  &= B_1^T,      \label{e.e1}\\[0.2em]
  L_2 E_2^T  &= B_2^T,      \label{e.e2}\\[0.2em]
  C          &= E_1 E_1^T + E_2 E_2^T + D D^T . \label{e.d}
\end{align}
That is, from \eqref{e.a1} and \eqref{e.a2}, the blocks $L_1$ and $L_2$ are given by Cholesky
factorizations of the blocks $A_1$ and $A_2$, respectively. Once these partial results are
available, the next task is to solve the two linear systems with multiple right-hand sides
\eqref{e.e1} and \eqref{e.e2} for the blocks $E_1$ and $E_2$, respectively. Finally, by rearranging
\eqref{e.d} into
\begin{equation}
\label{e.serial}
C  - E_1 E_1^T - E_2 E_2^T =  D D^T ,
\end{equation}
the block $D$ is given by another Cholesky factorization of the block $C  - E_1 E_1^T - E_2 E_2^T$.
